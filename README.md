# WinnieBot
## Our friendly interactive chatbot

The motivation behind WinnieBot was to create a scalable web-based platform where anyone can have general conversations, get any movie information, get weather updates and forecast of any global city on any specific day. In addition to that, WinnieBot is also capable of amusing the user with its jokes when he or she is feeling bored.
